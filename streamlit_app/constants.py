TEXTBOOK_QUESTIONS = ["In a chemistry class, you may have learned that the strength of an acid is determined by the stability of its conjugate base. Said another way, the $pK_a$ of an acid is lower---favoring dissociation into H$^+$ and A$^-$ if A$^-$ is relatively stable as an anion. Using the concept of electrostatic potential energy, how can this conception of the strength of acids be used to rationalize the increase in acidity as one goes down the halides from top to bottom: F, Cl, Br, I?", "Which part of the van der Waals interaction depends on temperature? Why?", "The Boltzmann constant times the temperature, $kT$, is often used as a measure of energy, called the \textbf{thermal energy}. The strength of a van der Waals bond of two small uncharged molecules is around 1 $kT$, for water---which exhibits strong hydrogen bonding---the strength of the interaction is around 10 $kT$. What is the value of the thermal energy at room temperature (298 K)? What is the approximate (order of magnitude) value of the strength of an ionic bond as in NaCl?", "Explain why butane (C$_4$H$_{10}$) is a gas at room temperature while octadecane (C$_{18}$H$_{38}$) is a solid.", "The situation depicted at the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:highlowpotential} seems to suggest that particles always spread out in a closed system due to entropy. That is, physical systems tend toward configurations which maximize the number of statistical microstates available. In light of this tendency, why do oil and water separate in salad dressing? What other forces do we have to consider?", "Imagine two particles that interact with a negative potential energy at a given distance of separation, $r$. Is the force attractive or repulsive? What information do you need about the interaction to know for sure?", "Recall the van der Waals equation of state from chemistry: it is the equation that makes corrections to the idea gas equation for attractive forces ($a$ parameter) and excluded volume ($b$ parameter). In light of what you learned in this chapter, how would you expect the $a$ and $b$ parameters of the Van der Waals equation of state to differ between iodine (I\textsubscript{2}) and chlorine (Cl\textsubscript{2}) gas?"]
TEXTBOOK_ANSWERS = ["You may have heard from your high school chemistry class that the strength of an acid increases in relation to the stability of its conjugate base. This phenomenon can also be understood from the standpoint of electrostatics dis- cussed in this chapter. For example, one of the ways to decrease the potential energy of a charge is to delocalize the charge over a larger volume or surface area. The way to think about this decreased potential energy, or rather, in- crease in stability, is by mentally breaking up the whole charge into lots of little infinitesimally small charges. These charges are then forced to occupy the same space. As the space gets bigger, the repulsion of the little charges experienced by each other decreases. So, looking at the halides—the group to the far right of the periodic table which goes from fluorine to iodine—the atomic and ionic radius gets bigger. As it gets bigger, the surface area increases with the square of the radius (and the volume increases with the cube of the radius) and thus the charge is delocalized over a larger structure. This reduced electrostatic self-repulsion of the negative charge of the conjugate base render it more electrostatically stable. This increased stability makes it easier for the proton and the conjugate base to disassociate, leading to a lower pK_a, and thus a stronger acid.", "Of the three components of the van der Waals interaction, only the dipole- dipole (a.k.a. Keesom) interaction depends on temperature. Notice in equation (2.4), them temperature appears in the denominator. Thus, an increase in temperature reduces the energy and force of the interaction. The reason for this inverse dependence on temperature has to do with the mental model we use to conceive of the dipole-dipole force. In the derivation of (2.4)— shown in Israelachvili in the Further Reading for the chapter—we assume that the dipolar molecules can rotate freely; they are not locked in place. Nevertheless, the average orientation of the positive end of one dipole tends to be pointed in the direction of the negative end of the adjacent dipolar molecule. As the temperature increases, the dipoles rotate more freely because there is more energy available to send the dipoles into orientations that are out of alignment with each other. That is, more of the angles between the dipoles end up being out of alignment with the electrostatically most favorable mutual configuration. At sufficiently high temperatures, there is no electrostatic effect at all and the dipoles rotate so freely that they are equally likely to have their ends pointed away from each other as they are to be pointed toward each other. So, T appears in the denominator, because as it increases, the overall favorability of the potential energy is reduced.", "The thermal energy, that is, the Boltzmann constant times the temperature at 298 K, kT , is about 4 × 10−21 J. This energy is equivalent to about 2.5 kJ mol−1, or 26 meV (millielectron volts). It is worth having a sense of these numbers so that if you are in a meeting and somebody gives you the strength of an interaction as being 1 kJ mol−1, you would know that it is not a very strong interaction. If the the potential energy—the “pair potential”—between two molecules is around 10 kT , then that material probably forms a condensed phase, meaning a solid or liquid, at room temperature. A good example is water, whose pair potential is very close to 10 kT. In contrast, a weak van der Waals interaction like the pair potential between two methane molecules is around 1 kT , which is not strong enough to form a liquid at room temperature. A very strong bond, like a covalent bond or an ionic bond, such as sodium chloride, NaCl, is around 100 kT.", "For linear hydrocarbons such as butane and octadecane, you get about 1.5 kT per CH2 (methylene) unit. (Note that butane in the reservoir of a cigarette lighter is a liquid, but only because it is pressurized. As soon as it escapes, it is a gas.) Thus, for butane, you have about 6 kT worth of pair potential, which does not quite reach the threshold of 10 kT that we use to determine if the molecule will condense into a liquid, as per the solution to the previous problem. However, for octadecane, the intermolecular pair potential due to van der Waals forces, primarily London dispersion interactions, is so strong that you easily form a solid, as there are two CH3 (methyl) units and sixteen CH2 units, which collectively produce quite a force!", "The driving force for any chemical interaction is given by the Gibbs free energy, \delta H = \delta G − T \delta S. Thus, there is a competition in any process between the two criteria of enthalpy (G) and entropy (S). Enthalpy has to do with the formation of bonds. It contributes to the favorability of a process when it decreases from the initial state to the final state. On the other hand, entropy has to do with the number of statistical microstates available. It contributes to the favorability of a process when it increases from the initial state to the final state. (The \delta s in the Gibbs free energy equation means that we have to consider whether the quantity increased or decreased after the reaction or process in question.) In any process where we are considering the dissolution of one component into another, the entropy of the mixed estate is usually greater than entropy of the separated state, thus entropy favors dissolution for most systems of solutes and solvents. (It is important to consider the effect of any dissolution or self-assembly process on not just the solute, but on the solvent as well!) However, mixing sometimes requires unlike molecules to interact with each other. You’ve heard the phrase “like dissolves like,” which is a good rule of thumb, but it leads one to a somewhat incorrect view of the mechanism. For example, it may in fact be true that two unlike molecules have a favorable energy (negative enthalpy) of interaction. However, all that is required is for the self interaction of two like molecules to be stronger than the interaction between two unlike molecules. If the difference between these two energies is sufficient to overwhelm the driving force for mixing which is always provided by entropy, then the two components will separate, just like oil and water.", "From the information given, it is impossible to know whether the force will be attractive or repulsive. What is important is not the sign of the energy at any particular configuration, but what happens to the energy—whether it increases or decreases—as the geometry changes. Formally, the force is equal to the negative rate of change of the potential energy with respect to some geometric change, commonly interparticle separation, r, or the intersurface separation, D (see Chapter 3). If the energy increases as the particles get closer, then convince yourself based on equation (2.3) that the force is positive and therefore repulsive. So, we are missing information. We do not need to know the absolute value of the energy or the sign of the energy so much as what happens to that energy—does it increase or decrease?—as the particles get closer together or further part. The force has a physical manifestation; the energy does not.", "In the van der Waals equation of state, which is a correction to the ideal gas law that accounts for the interatomic or intermolecular forces, a, and the excluded volume, b, the parameter a is an experimental measure of the van der Waals interaction potential and the parameter b is simply a measure of the physical volume of the particle. A greater attractive force between particles would tend to reduce the measured pressure at the sidewalls of a sample of a van der Waals gas. The reason being that because there are by definition no molecules of gas beyond the walls, the molecules near the edges experience a net inward force from those closer to the center. And the pressure, after all, is measured at the walls of the container, not at the interior. That is the effect of a. The effect of b, on the other hand, is different. The b parameter represents the total volume excluded by the presence of the molecules or atoms of gas. A greater excluded volume reduces the actual volume available in the con- tainer for the other molecules to move around. The reduction in volume is exactly equivalent to putting the molecules in a smaller box, except that the space is “removed” throughout the volume of the box, just like the air bubbles distributed throughout the bulk of a block of Swiss cheese (at least what we call “Swiss cheese” in North America) reduces the actual volume of the cheese part of the cheese. Because the pressure is increased. For chlorine, we have a relatively small diatomic gas, so its a parameter and b parameter would be decreased compared to iodine, which is a much larger diatomic gas. The effect on van der Waals force is quite large, in that with many more protons and electrons, you have a much more polarizable species, and thus the overall van der Waals force will be higher because of the larger London dispersion interaction."]
