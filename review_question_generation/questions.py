In Lennard-Jones potential, Does the first part of the equation (-A/r^6) is represented the repulsive and the second part of the equation (B/r^12) will be attractive?", "1) I think it's going to depend on the problem.\n 2) other way around, first part is attractive, second part is repulsive (negative energies/forces are favorable by convention)"], ["I understand that we have to focus on potential energy in the nanoscale rather than kinetic energy. The most crucial factor that affects the potential energy of atoms or molecules is the van der Waal force. Van der Waal force is quite strong and most likely makes molecules attract each other. This force can be distinguished into three forces: dipole-dipole, dipole-induce, and London. There is also a force that prevents or acts against Van der Wall force, which is Lennard-Jones potential. I see some examples of how the van der Wall force affects our life, but I want to see more examples of how it can change the properties of materials.", "The Lennard Jones potential is a model / equation that describes van der Waals interactions, not a force that acts against the van der Waals force. I think you're thinking of the Pauli exclusion principle, which is the repulsive component in the Lennard Jones potential."], ["What is absolute zero in regard to dipole-dipole forces? Why is it so hard to achieve and is there any way to do so?", "Absolute zero is a theoretical concept referring to the lowest possible temperature, at this temperature (0 Kelvin, -273.15°C, or -459.67°F), all motion of particles (atoms and molecules) would cease, and they would also be in their lowest quantum-mechanical energy state. In the context of dipole-dipole forces, reaching absolute zero would mean that the motion associated with these interactions would also theoretically cease. That is, the thermal motion that usually opposes dipole-dipole attractions would be minimized, leading to a stable arrangement of dipoles. Dipole-dipole interactions play a role in phenomena like hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces and influence the properties of various materials. In practice, absolute zero is not an achievable temperature, although researchers have gotten quite close!"],["If there was a system with charged particles (opposite charges)  grouped close together, would it still have a high PE like the entropic system example or a low one like the electrostatic example (Fig. 2.2)? On page 11, \"Force is the rate of change of the potential energy with respect to some change in the system,\" what are examples of a \"change in the system?\"", 'It would have a low PE due to the strength of the electrostatic (Coulombic) attraction between the oppositely charged particles. Entropy would theoretically oppose constraining a set of particles in a small space, but that would not produce a noticeable effect in comparison to the Coulomb/electrostatic attractionbetween oppositely charged particles.\n A typical example of Change in the system might be a change in the distance between two charged particles. It’s a change in position - that’s how force and energy are related',], ["I'm getting confused on all the different forces and temperatures that are being brought up and how they are relating to a bond's strength, as well as the state of matter they are said to be in. Also about the Pauli exclusion principle, isn't there something in like quantum mechanics where atoms have a very very tiny chance of tunneling and phasing through one another?", "Yes, quantum tunneling is a phenomenon where particles have a non-zero probability of passing through energy barriers that would be considered impassable given the laws of classical mechanics. However, the Pauli Exclusion Principle still holds in these scenarios. This principle states that no two identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin like electrons, protons, and neutrons) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously within a quantum system. Essentially, even if particles were to tunnel through each other or an energy barrier, their wave functions must still be orthogonal—meaning they can't occupy the same state in the system. So, quantum tunneling doesn't violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Rather, tunneling involves the transition between different, non-overlapping quantum states."], ["In the equation for the total polarizability, I don't quite follow the meaning of alpha 0, alpha dp and alpha. I'm assuming alpha 0 is how much we can move the electron cloud using induced dipole, alpha dp is the electron cloud from internal partial charge, and alpha is the total amount how much electron cloud is able to move.", "Your interpretation of alpha is correct. Alpha_0 represents the susceptibility of an electron cloud to be displaced from its equilibrium position, or “polarized”, by an external electric field. This displacement of the electron cloud is what causes or “induces” a temporary dipole. Alpha_dip represents the ability of an existing dipole to be oriented by an external electric field, so it is also a relevant component of a molecule’s total polarizability, particularly for molecules with permanent dipoles. However, we won’t be going into depth on this topic during the course."], ["Are dipole-induced forces only caused by the electron clouds of the larger molecule? In figure 2.3 argon should have a negative dipole as its deflecting from the CL-H with a negative dipole, do the dipole induced forces only occur between two molecules with a similar dipole?", "Dipole-induced dipole forces occur between molecules with a permanent dipole and any other kind of molecule, regardless of size."]]
